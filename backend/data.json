The pink color is absolutely gorgeous‚Äîit's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I‚Äôve received so many compliments on it already.<br><br>The design is everything you‚Äôd expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it‚Äôs almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, ‚ÄúWelcome to the 21st century!‚Äù<br><br>The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It‚Äôs crazy how much has changed‚Äîface ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.<br><br>If you‚Äôre thinking about upgrading, especially if you‚Äôre coming from a much older model like I was, don‚Äôt hesitate.

Watching videos or scrolling through photos is a treat for the eyes. No complaints here!<br><br>Hanging: Zero issues with hanging or lagging. This phone handles multitasking like a champ. Switching between apps is smooth, and I haven't experienced any frustrating delays.<br><br>Battery: The battery life is surprisingly impressive. I can go a full day with normal usage, and it still has juice left in the tank. No more anxiously searching for a charger midday ‚Äì a definite win!<br><br>Comfort: The sleek design makes it a pleasure to hold, and the phone is just the right weight. It feels premium and comfortable in my hand, making it a joy to use for extended periods.<br><br>Image Quality: The camera on the iPhone 13 is a true standout. The photos are sharp, and the night mode is a game-changer for capturing memories in low light. Selfies have never looked this good!<br><br>Color: I went for the classic Midnight color, and it's elegant and timeless. The finish adds a touch of sophistication, and it doesn't attract fingerprints like some other phones I've had in the past.<br><br>In summary, getting the iPhone 13 during the Great Indian Festival was an absolute steal. From the incredible screen to the reliable battery life and stunning camera, it's exceeded my expectations. If you're on the fence, take the plunge ‚Äì you won't be disappointed."},{"review":"I really wanted to get an iPhone and it is my first iPhone but i loved it the sound quality is great and it charges fast, the phone is a bit heavy but it looks classy the display also works well and the camera is the best ü§çü§ç"},{"review":"Things I liked:<br>1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)<br>2. Camera:<br>-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.<br>3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.<br>4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.<br>5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.<br><br>Things I wish were better:<br>1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)<br><br>2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%<br><br>3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.<br><br>4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts. Number pad does not detect contact unless complete number is typed."},{"review":""},{"review":"I am happy to share that my personal review. iPhone is very smooth to handle. Display was too good. Camera quality is amazing.<br>Worth it üëç"},{"review":"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using Samsung S10 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-<br>1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User<br>2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.<br>3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.<br>4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.<br>5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.<br>6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet \"A\", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.<br>7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.<br>8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.<br>9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.<br><br>These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customization is really good and you can customize a lot of things."},{"review":"After purchasing the iPhone 13, I‚Äôm genuinely impressed with its performance and features. Here‚Äôs a detailed review based on my experience:<br><br>### Design and Build Quality<br>The iPhone 13 feels incredibly premium in hand. The flat edges and matte finish on the back give it a sleek and modern look. The build quality is top-notch, with the Ceramic Shield front adding a layer of durability that gives me confidence in its longevity.<br><br>### Display<br>The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display is absolutely stunning. The colors are vibrant, and the blacks are deep, making everything from photos to videos look fantastic. The brightness levels are impressive, and even in direct sunlight, the screen remains perfectly readable. The slightly smaller notch is a nice touch, offering a bit more screen space.<br><br>### Performance<br>The A15 Bionic chip is a powerhouse. The iPhone 13 handles everything I throw at it with ease, from multitasking to gaming. Apps open almost instantly, and there's no lag whatsoever. It‚Äôs clear that this phone is built for speed and efficiency.<br><br>### Camera<br>The camera system on the iPhone 13 is a standout feature. The 12MP wide and ultra-wide lenses capture stunning photos with great detail and color accuracy. Low-light performance is particularly impressive, thanks to the sensor-shift optical image stabilization. The new Photographic Styles and Cinematic mode are fantastic additions, allowing for creative freedom and professional-looking videos.<br><br>### Battery Life<br>Battery life has been a pleasant surprise. I easily get through a full day of use on a single charge, even with heavy usage. The efficiency of the A15 Bionic chip and the slightly larger battery make a noticeable difference compared to previous models.<br><br>### Software<br>iOS 15 is smooth and intuitive. The new features like Focus modes, enhanced FaceTime capabilities, and improved privacy controls make the user experience even better. Everything feels well-integrated and easy to use.<br><br>### Overall Impression<br>The iPhone 13 has exceeded my expectations. It offers a perfect balance of performance, design, and innovative features. Whether it‚Äôs the stunning display, powerful camera system, or impressive battery life, every aspect of this phone feels well-thought-out and polished. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a premium smartphone experience."},{"review":"Every thing is good about iPhones, there's nothing compared to it's speed and ios but i was disappointed because there's no charger for it even though Indian judiciary told them to provide , still they haven't made any progress regarding charger.

The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13."},{"review":"Genuine apple product, delivered as promised by Amazon.

Excellent camera both during day and night with a good battery life."},{"review":"Genuine product, verified from Apple Site as well as from Apple Retailers. Very smooth touch screen. Excellent security features."},{"review":"About the phone<br>Apple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.<br><br>Why it is better than Android?<br>You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.<br><br>Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14<br>The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find \"the very few changes\" interesting in 14,  go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)<br>14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)<br><br>Concern you must have.<br>Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.<br><br>Apple care.<br>I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better."},{"review":"It is genuine apple , I conformed it with the apple store in my city.
