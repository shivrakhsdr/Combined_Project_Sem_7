An ok product..",4.0,"GUYS PLEASE READ:Hello fellow cat lovers..B4 u cursed this product that ur cat vomitted or had indigestion or bla bla bla, just keep in mind that cats have a delicate taste palette..Which means u were feeding ur cat another variety of cat food b4 u bought this. It takes time for cats to adjust to their new food. They might even get sick if u suddenly change to another new food.Since this was a 1+1 deal, i got it. It was a good price. And cheaper than WHISKAS. But unfortunately, my cat doesn't like the taste of this alone. But that doesn't mean this product was bad. The problem with this product is, since its cheaper the quality is lesser than that of whiskas. I have no complains.HOW DO I KNOW?Its simple!B4 u Ewwww me, think again why u love ur cat and would do anything for them.I love my cat to the moon and back, so whenever i buy him a new food, i taste a little of it to make sure it taste fine. So If am ok, so will be my cat (cats eat human food too so its fine if i taste a little, u don't want to let ur little baby have something which taste awful. Would u?) I have tasted both the dry WHISKAS and this new food.There's a little difference in the taste department. Whiskas taste better and is on higher end.But let's be rational, we can't expect a good deal cheaper end goods with the higher end quality. Simple as that!So here's what i did..I mix a little of the new food with the old food he usually have and increase the dosage of the new food little by little to make sure my cat doesn't get upset stomach. I still do that. And he is completely fine. And he loves it.I'd advise u guys to do the same and not switch suddenly.GOOD LUCK CAT PARENTS

Does what it is meant to do - to perfection!",5.0,"This is expensive and surely not a necessity in case you have a fish bowl or a nano tank. But in case you have a large tank, a crowded tank, or have fishes dying then this is the best option to know the water parameters andctake required measures. The results are perfect although the steps take some time. The kit should easily last 6 months plus and hence you will get value for money.

In a well cycled tank - Ammonia and Nitrite must be 0ppm(VERYImportant) and Nitrate also within acceptable limits.This is a must for any aquarium and specially useful for any new tank setups where you need to monitor the water conditions regularly during the cycling process.Based on the results, you can take decision for water changes.

Good water testing chemicals at an affordable price",5.0,"Very well packed and company sealed Original product received.It's Made in the USA and not the (API- Aquarium Products India). 4 test tubes with stoppers come along in the kit. You Can Check Ph, High Range Ph(If you have Cichlids that need high Ph), Ammonia, Nitrite, and Nitrate. Wish it had Chlorine, Iron, Calcium, Magnesium, and Phosphate checking too though they are very cheap chemicals but should have been added. To get the accurate value you have to shake the hell out of the bottles for 30 seconds or you will get the wrong result. The Stick method is easier to use and just takes a minute and with this, you have to make a Chemistry lab on your table.eSHa is one more company that makes awesome test sticks. You just dip it in the aquarium and match the colors and it's 1000 rupees cheaper. It's also available on Amazon. You can choose between the two. Hope the review was helpful. Do hit the thumbs up I just want to see how many of you guys got benefitted from my review.

Not very useful as a treat but good as a calcium suppliment.",3.0,"I thought that it was made up of raw-hide but I was wrong. These calcium bones don't even last 5 seconds. My pooches can easily gulp it down their throat which makes it not a very enjoyable treat. It doesn't provide the stimulation that a raw-hide stick provides.You can use it as a suppliment for calcium but it's not a good option for treats.

Good for puppies",4.0,"This is best for puppies because these bones are soft, so puppies can easily eat them. However, if your only goal is to give calcium to your dog, then you can give this a try, but your goal is to get calcium and also to keep your dog busy chewing the bones, so you need to find another option because this is so soft that your dog can finish it in minutes.

Beach sand with a hint of clumping. Never again.",2.0,"Grainy sand with a hint of bentonite is my assessment. DO NOT go by the product pic which shows reasonable sized litter grains. This stuff is more comparable to beach sand.  Clumps form, and then DISINTEGRATE the moment cats move the litter around. The disintegrated chunks are too small to be caught by the scoop. Cat pee mixes with this stuff and  sticks to bottom of litter box in chunks.  Tried removing the chunks and they crumble into small pieces and cannot be scooped out, eventually mixing up with the good litter.  Started smelling after 1 week of use by 1 cat.  Waste of money. Never again.

Great, but TOO COSTLY.",4.0,"Extreme-ness confirmed.My 9 month old Lab is a compulsive chewer and it doesn't even bear a scratch.It even has an unpredictable bounce to make it a backyard fetch toy.It's good in many ways but doesn't live up to its cost, to be frank.My only issue is that Kong's not a super toy. He has many other toys, most of which are cheap and withstand him (for eg:¬†
Super Dog Spiked Rubber Dog Ball (Color May Vary)
¬†which even has something that makes it smell pleasant all the time, however long it stays in my pooch's mouth.)It's made of tyre-like material and smells exactly like it.So if you have a pup/dog who has a short attention span, don't count on Kong to be his favourite toy forever. Sure he may be engaged for a day or two. But your furniture is still not safe.Also, kibble dispensing isn't as effective.Pro tip: Insert a piece of roti or bread in the end to slow down their speed.

Most loved toy of my 2 yr old American Bully",5.0,"I just adopted a 23Kg American Bully. He came with the classic wide jaw and bite strength, so I got the Extreme.Of all his toys, this is the one he is most possessive of. This is the one he chooses when he is most excited. This is the one i leave him with so that my furniture is safe when I leave the house and have to leave him home alone.It has chipped a little on the edge of the larger size, but it seems to be nowhere near falling apart or being unusable. And he really really goes at it! He loves it even more than real bones (never seen this in another dog).Very glad I bought this toy for him.

Perfect for power chewers",5.0,"We purchased this for our power chewer as he's developed a bit of separation anxiety after his knee surgery.  I have to say it works like a charm, we load it up with treats before he leave him alone, it gives him something to do for half an hour, after which he's so tired he falls asleep.  We also use it for feeding him dog food sometimes, and in summers we freeze a meat and veggie combo and let him at it in the heat.  It's been a big help in satisfying his chewing needs, he's barely made a dent in the product, even though it's been used every single day for a year.  It's been bounced and thrown and used as a plaything, and frozen and thawed, still is the same as it was when we bought it, very happy with all my kong products.

¬†I have like different variety of chichlids in two of my 3ft tanks. I have tried many foods before and offcourse the occasional treats as blood worms and bsf larvae. You cant feed the fish bloodworms everyday and you need a good quality regular food to rely on. This is the best. You can read the composition of protein, it doesnt odour the water as well. All my fishes including cory and sucker fishes as well like to munch on it. The food also has agents to ensure your fish gets supplements for UV light that may not be in your tank. The only thing I wish here is if the same varient was available in sinking too. I have to do it manually with injection.

An ok product..",4.0,"GUYS PLEASE READ:Hello fellow cat lovers..B4 u cursed this product that ur cat vomitted or had indigestion or bla bla bla, just keep in mind that cats have a delicate taste palette..Which means u were feeding ur cat another variety of cat food b4 u bought this. It takes time for cats to adjust to their new food. They might even get sick if u suddenly change to another new food.Since this was a 1+1 deal, i got it. It was a good price. And cheaper than WHISKAS. But unfortunately, my cat doesn't like the taste of this alone. But that doesn't mean this product was bad. The problem with this product is, since its cheaper the quality is lesser than that of whiskas. I have no complains.HOW DO I KNOW?Its simple!B4 u Ewwww me, think again why u love ur cat and would do anything for them.I love my cat to the moon and back, so whenever i buy him a new food, i taste a little of it to make sure it taste fine. So If am ok, so will be my cat (cats eat human food too so its fine if i taste a little, u don't want to let ur little baby have something which taste awful. Would u?) I have tasted both the dry WHISKAS and this new food.There's a little difference in the taste department. Whiskas taste better and is on higher end.But let's be rational, we can't expect a good deal cheaper end goods with the higher end quality. Simple as that!So here's what i did..I mix a little of the new food with the old food he usually have and increase the dosage of the new food little by little to make sure my cat doesn't get upset stomach. I still do that. And he is completely fine. And he loves it.I'd advise u guys to do the same and not switch suddenly.GOOD LUCK CAT PARENTS

It still smells a bit looks a bit shabby. The only down side of this product is that dust particles and pet heair gets stuck in between the folds and is hard to clean it completely..

¬†The packaging was great. Delivery was on time. The product is amazing. My cat loved it. She instantly saw the hanging toy and started playing with it. For now she just sits in it for a few minutes. It may take some more time for her to get comfortable with her new house. It is quite sturdy but if your cat is on a heavier side and sleeps towards the end the house tilts behind so you will have to keep it touched to a wall. It may vary from cats to cats. But overall go for it it's worth the money.
