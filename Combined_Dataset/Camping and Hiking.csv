Great Buy!",5.0,"- Great bag for the price- Offers many compartments, great quality materials & zippers, straps, even the rain cover.- Comfortable- big enough to pack stuff for weeks.- looks really great- a similar wildcraft bag costs you about 5-6k, hence buying this is a no brainerCons : Only 1Y warranty, but its sturdy enough to last yearsPS : I have travelled but not trekked with this yet

Â Threads are going see pic.  Not good. No back support. Very bad quality. Vip disappointed me. My trip would have been a disaster. I will take wildcraft now. Wildcraft has back support. But wildcraft dosent have any pockets and small belt pocket for keeping id cards.  Aristocrat has all pockets for keeping things. But no good quality
