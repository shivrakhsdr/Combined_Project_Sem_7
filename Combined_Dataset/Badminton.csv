The packaging was also decent, but there was a slight bent to the rod of one when it arrived. Managed to almost straighten it with some force.

Good but Yonex ZR 100 is better",4.0,"We bought two racquets, Head Reflex 20 and Yonex ZR 100.This one is slighltly heavier than Yonex.The strings are thick.It was interesting to note that racquet developed a slight bend on first day of playing. This was also observed with Yonex though.The grip of Yonex's racquet is better.The cover too is better of Yonex.For little more money, ZR 100 is a better deal.

All cocks are squished and out of shape. The shuttle cock is too light and does not reach the other side of the court sometimes even when hitting at full power. The base came off in 15-20 minutes of playing. Whereas we can play with Yonex shuttlecock for a month before it breaks. Even after gluing the base to the skirt [this also increased the weight and made it more playable], the base got compressed and the skirt broke off after 2 days.
